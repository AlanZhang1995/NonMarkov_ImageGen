Unfortunately, we are unable to provide the code or dataset due to policy restrictions.

This page serves as a reference to [our extended arXiv version](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2601.20911), which provides a more detailed discussion of non-markov multi-round image generation. We have completed both Rollback-Style Non-Markov Multi-Round Editing and Name-Based Non-Markov Multi-Round Personalization. However, due to page limitations, only the personalization component is presented in the WACV paper. 

This extended version constitutes the full report. We sincerely hope it will inspire further research on the design and construction of non-Markov datasets.
